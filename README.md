# Research and development of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) using FPGA system

The purpose of this project is to design transmitter and receiver systems for wireless transmission applications between two
devices. Transmitter packages data in frame by frame and encodes data using QAM before sending the frames to receiver.
Data is transmitted through space environment. Afterwards, Receiver synchronizes and decodes transmitted data. the
system is implemented in two FPGA boards (Xilinx XC6SLX45).
